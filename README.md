mw2-server
=================================================================================

This tool provides the ability to create a simulated COD:MW2 server (for projects (ahem, copycats) that employ this type of server system).

It currently supports RepzIW4, IW4Play, Orion (Triobit), Plusmaster, and anything else that uses the same type of server logic - and likely anything that doesn't, with regular updating constantly fixing the little issues projects try to impose upon this project.

=================================================================================

To configure the server, click on the little help box on the topright of the tool. 

- Hostname: Hostname of your server.
- Gametype: Gametype of your server (note that the gametype must not contain any spaces!).
- Mapname: Mapname (fill in anything you want, even if the map doesn't exist).
- Maxclients: Maximum amount of clients on this server.
- Clients: Current amount of clients on the server.
- Mod: Server mod (Name of the a simulated mod running through fs_game - This will also be displayed as gametype, if your gametype is valid)
- Port: UDP Port the server runs on (changing it requires to restart the tool)
- Error: Error message that gets displayed to clients upon joining.
- Spam: Enter any text you want, this will get displayed on every clients console when updating the server list.
